## License for the combined work (Virt Blocks and its dependencies)

While Virt Blocks itself is LGPL-2.1-or-later, some of its
dependencies are Apache-2.0, which due to the well-documented
incompatibility between LGPL-2.1-only and Apache-2.0 results in the
combined work being upgraded to LGPL-3.0-or-later.

So if you're copying parts of Virt Blocks into your own project or
creating a modified version of it, then you have to comply with
LGPL-2.1-or-later; if you use Virt Blocks as a dependency of your
own project, however, you need to comply with LGPL-3.0-or-later.
